# F5 Monitoring Extension
 
The F5 load balancer from F5 Networks, Inc. directs traffic away from servers that are overloaded or down to other servers that can handle the load. The F5 load balancer extension collects key performance metrics from an F5 load balancer and presents them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.
